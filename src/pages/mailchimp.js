          This was a project that I worked on during my time as a brand design
          intern at Mailchimp. This sweatshirt was designed with the intention
          to unite and comfort employees during uncertain and scary times. By
          using contrasting typography and unified flowers the design touches on
          coming together despite differences and uncertainties, and comfort
          through the colors. The sweatshirt was designed for the Mailchimp
          Rainbow Room, a store for employeeâ€™s accomplishments.
